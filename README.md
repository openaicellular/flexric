# FlexRIC

This repository contains [O-RAN Alliance](https://www.o-ran.org/) compliant E2 Node Agent emulators, a nearRT-RIC, and xApps written in C/C++ and Python.
It implements various service models (O-RAN standard KPM v2.01/v2.03/v3.00 and RC v1.03, as well as customized NG/GTP, PDCP, RLC, MAC, SC and TC). 
Depending on the service model, different encoding schemes have been developed (ASN.1, flatbuffer, plain). 
The indication data received in the xApp uses as persistence mechanism an sqlite3 database for enabling offline processing applications (e.g., ML/AI). 
Moreover it supports E2AP v1.01/v2.03/v3.01 for all the SMs.

If you want to know more about FlexRIC and its original architecture, you can find more details at: Robert Schmidt, Mikel Irazabal, and Navid Nikaein. 2021.

  On Ubuntu, you might want to use [this PPA](https://apt.kitware.com/) to install an up-to-date version.

### 1.1.3 Flatbuffer encoding (optional)
  
  We also provide a flatbuffers encoding/decoding scheme as alternative to ASN.1. In case that you want to use it  follow the
  instructions at https://github.com/dvidelabs/flatcc and provide the path for the lib and include when selecting it at `ccmake ..` from the build directory 

## 1.2 Download the required dependencies

### 1.2.1 Mandatory dependencies
  ```bash
  sudo apt install libsctp-dev cmake-curses-gui libpcre2-dev
  ```

### 1.2.2 Multi-language xApp requirements (optional)
  - SWIG (at least  v.4.1). 

    We use SWIG as an interface generator to enable the multi-language feature (i.e., C/C++ and Python) for the xApps. Please, check your SWIG version (i.e, `swig
    -version`) and install it from scratch if necessary as described here: https://swig.org/svn.html or via the code below: 

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/swig/swig.git
    cd swig
    git checkout release-4.1 
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --prefix=/usr/
    make -j8
    make install
    ```

  - Python dependencies
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install python3.10 python3.10-dev
    ```

# 2. Deployment

## 2.1 FlexRIC

### 2.1.1 Clone the FlexRIC repository
  ```bash
  git clone https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/mosaic5g/flexric
  cd flexric/
  git checkout dev
  ```

### 2.1.2 Build FlexRIC
  ```bash
  mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make -j8
  ```
  If you have installed optional libraries from section [1.2.2 Multi-language xApp requirements (optional)](#122-multi-language-xapp-requirements-optional), run the following command:
  ```bash
  mkdir build && cd build && cmake -DXAPP_MULTILANGUAGE=ON .. && make -j8
  ```

  * Note:
    Currently available versions:
    |            |KPM v2.01|KPM v2.03|KPM v3.00|
    |:-----------|:--------|:--------|:--------|
    | E2AP v1.01 | Y       | Y       | Y       |
    | E2AP v2.03 | Y       | Y       | Y       |
    | E2AP v3.01 | Y       | Y       | Y       |

    By default, FlexRIC will build the nearRT-RIC with E2AP v2.03 and KPM v2.03. If you are interested in other available versions, please, execute this command:
    ```bash
    mkdir build && cd build && cmake -DE2AP_VERSION=E2AP_VX -DKPM_VERSION=KPM_VY .. && make -j8
    ```
    where `X`=`1`,`2`,`3`, and `Y`=`2_01`,`2_03`,`3_00`.


### 2.1.3 Installation of Service Models (SMs)
  ```bash
  sudo make install
  ```

  By default the service model libraries will be installed in the path `/usr/local/lib/flexric` while the configuration file in `/usr/local/etc/flexric`.

  * Note: Command `sudo make install` installs shared libraries that represent Service Models. Each time E2AP and/or KPM versions are modified, the command must be executed again.

Check that everything went fine by running unit tests:
```bash
ctest -j8 --output-on-failure
```
 
# 3. Service Models available in OAI RAN

## 3.1 O-RAN

For a deeper understanding, we recommend that users of FlexRIC familiarize themselves with O-RAN WG3 specifications available at the [O-RAN specifications page](https://orandownloadsweb.azurewebsites.net/specifications).

The following specifications are recommended:
- O-RAN.WG3.E2GAP-v02.00 - nearRT-RIC architecture & E2 General Aspects and Principles
- O-RAN.WG3.E2AP-v02.03 - E2AP protocol description
- O-RAN.WG3.E2SM-KPM-v02.03 - KPM Service Model description
- O-RAN.WG3.E2SM-RC-v01.03 - RAN Control Service Model description

### 3.1.1 E2SM-KPM

  As mentioned in section [2.1.2 Build FlexRIC](#212-build-flexric), we support KPM v2.01/v2.03/v3.00. Uses ASN.1 encoding.

  Per O-RAN specifications, 5G measurements supported by KPM are specified in 3GPP TS 28.552.

  From 3GPP TS 28.552, at the moment, we support the following list:
  * `DRB.PdcpSduVolumeDL`
  * `DRB.PdcpSduVolumeUL`
  * `DRB.RlcSduDelayDl`
  * `DRB.UEThpDl`
  * `DRB.UEThpUl`
  * `RRU.PrbTotDl`
  * `RRU.PrbTotUl`

  From O-RAN.WG3.E2SM-KPM-version specification, we implemented:
  * REPORT Service Style 4 ("Common condition-based, UE-level" - section 7.4.5) - fetch above measurements per each UE that matches common criteria (e.g. S-NSSAI).

### 3.1.2 E2SM-RC

  We support RC v1.03. Uses ASN.1 encoding.

  From ORAN.WG3.E2SM-RC-v01.03 specification, we implemented:
  * REPORT Service Style 4 ("UE Information" - section 7.4.5) - aperiodic subscription for "UE RRC State Change"
  * CONTROL Service Style 1 ("Radio Bearer Control" - section 7.6.2) - "QoS flow mapping configuration" (e.g creating a new DRB)

## 3.2 Custom Service Models

In addition, we support custom Service Models, such as MAC, RLC, PDCP, and GTP. All use plain encoding, i.e., no ASN.1, but write the binary data into network messages.

# 4. Usage/deployment

## 4.1 Test with emulators

Run Wireshark and capture E2AP traffic. Per O-RAN.WG3.E2GAP-v02.00 specifications, no SCTP port is specified for E2AP protocol. In our implementation, we use port number 36421. Please, add the following configuration in Wireshark:

![E2AP configuration](fig/4.png)

  * Start the nearRT-RIC
    ```bash
    ./build/examples/ric/nearRT-RIC
    ```

  * Start E2 Node agents

    * gNB-mono
      ```bash
      ./build/examples/emulator/agent/emu_agent_gnb
      ```
    * if CU/DU split is used, start the gNB as follows
      ```bash
      ./build/examples/emulator/agent/emu_agent_gnb_cu
      ./build/examples/emulator/agent/emu_agent_gnb_du
      ```

Check that you see the E2 Setup Request and Response messages in Wireshark. 
Within E2 Setup Request message, E2 node sends his own capabilities, such are KPM and RC supported RAN Functions.

  * Start different C xApps

    * start the KPM monitor xApp - measurements stated in [3.1.1 E2SM-KPM](#311-e2sm-kpm)
      ```bash
      ./build/examples/xApp/c/monitor/xapp_kpm_moni
      ```

    * start the RC monitor xApp - aperiodic subscription for "UE RRC State Change"
      ```bash
      ./build/examples/xApp/c/monitor/xapp_rc_moni
      ```

    * start the RC control xApp - RAN control function "QoS flow mapping configuration" (e.g. creating a new DRB)
      ```bash
      ./build/examples/xApp/c/kpm_rc/xapp_kpm_rc
      ```

    * start the (MAC + RLC + PDCP + GTP) monitor xApp
      ```bash
      ./build/examples/xApp/c/monitor/xapp_gtp_mac_rlc_pdcp_moni
      ```

  * if `XAPP_MULTILANGUAGE` option is enabled, start the python xApps:
    ```bash
    python3 build/examples/xApp/python3/xapp_mac_rlc_pdcp_gtp_moni.py
    python3 build/examples/xApp/python3/xapp_slice_moni_ctrl.py
    ```

  Please, notice that no real UE is connected. Therefore, random values within supported messages are filled.

  Before starting the nearRT-RIC, check that the IP address where your nearRT-RIC will be listening is the desired one at `/usr/local/etc/flexric/flexric.conf`.
  Infact the default configuration assumes all the components are located in the same localhost. 

  Additionally, feel free to customize your own config files. Here is one example:
  ```bash
  ./build/examples/emulator/agent/emu_agent_gnb_cu -c ~/flexric1.conf &
  ./build/examples/emulator/agent/emu_agent_gnb_du -c ~/flexric2.conf &
  ```

  where, `flexric1.conf` is: 
  ```
  [NEAR-RIC]
  NEAR_RIC_IP = 127.0.0.1
  [XAPP]
  DB_PATH = /tmp/
  DB_NAME = xapp_db1
  ```

  `flexric2.conf` is: 
  ```
  [NEAR-RIC]
  NEAR_RIC_IP = 127.0.0.1
  [XAPP]
  DB_PATH = /tmp/
  DB_NAME = xapp_db2
  ```

It is also interesting to mention, multiple xApps can be run in parallel.

At this point, FlexRIC is working correctly in your computer and you have already tested the multi-agent, multi-xApp and multi-language capabilities. 

The latency that you observe in your monitor xApp is the latency from the E2 Agent to the nearRT-RIC and xApp. In modern computers the latency should be less than 200 microseconds or 50x faster than the O-RAN specified minimum nearRT-RIC latency i.e., (10 ms - 1 sec) range.
Therefore, FlexRIC is well suited for use cases with ultra low-latency requirements.
Additionally, all the data received in the xApp is also written to `/tmp/xapp_db` in case that offline data processing is wanted (e.g., Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence applications). You browse the data using e.g., sqlitebrowser. 
Please, check the example folder for other working xApp use cases.

## 4.2 Docker (optional step)

  We build regularly FlexRIC using docker files for Ubuntu20 and Ubuntu22. You can find the `Dockerfile` at:
  ```bash
  cd test/docker/
  ```

# 5. Integration with RAN and example of deployment

## 5.1 Integration with OpenAirInterface 5G RAN

Follow the instructions https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/openairinterface5g/-/blob/develop/openair2/E2AP/README.md

## 5.2 Integration with srsRAN 5G RAN

Follow the instructions https://docs.srsran.com/projects/project/en/latest/tutorials/source/flexric/source/index.html 

## 5.3 Integration with Keysight RICtest 

The nearRT-RIC has been successfully tested with Keysight's RICtest RAN emulator https://www.keysight.com/us/en/product/P8828S/rictest-ran-intelligent-controller-test-solutions.html, 
as demonstrated at O-RAN PlugFest Fall 2023. Specifically, the nearRT-RIC with the xApp `flexric/examples/xApp/c/keysight/xapp_keysight_kpm_rc.c` were tested.

## 5.4 Synchronize clock (optional)

Before running the various components (RAN/nearRT-RIC/xApps), you probably want to align the machines' clock. For this aim, you can use `ptp4l` in all the machines
involved (if you have for example deployed the various components on different hosts)

```bash
sudo ptp4l -m -i InterfaceName #for master
sudo ptp4l -m -i InterfaceName -s #for slaves
```

![alt text](fig/2.png)

Following make sure that no ntpd, chrondy or timesyncd is running in the system (e.g., `sudo systemctl stop systemd-timesyncd`). 

```bash
sudo phc2sys -m -s InterfaceName -w
```
